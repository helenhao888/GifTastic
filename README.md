### Overview

Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the user's choice. 


1. There are 20 initial topics. When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

2. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

3. When user clicks more, it gets 10 more images.

4. User can input a topic  from a user input box and adds it to your `topics`  the buttons on the page.

5. Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a `favorites` section.
   * This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.
   * This favorite persist even when the page is reloaded
